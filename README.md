## Introduction
This repository provides instructional documents on LiDAR analysis with Python in the context of forest resources. Python provides
us many efficient libraries that are able to handle large data sets if used well, and we can often avoid the use of lower level programming languages if we do a few clever tricks. This repository shows how basic LiDAR analysis
functions work, and how to visualize, interpret and process LiDAR data sets in Python, with the goal of incorporating the lessons
into a standalone package in the future.

These examples assume you have a working knowledge of Python, [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) and other packages, although I wrote them to be accessible to a wide audience. Some examples are written as intentional simplifications of complex processes. This is to get across the general structure of the program, rather than precise outputs.

The following is a living document, with frequent updates. Please check back in for more content as it is added.

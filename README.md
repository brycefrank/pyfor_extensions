This repository provides instructional documents on LiDAR analysis with Python in the context of forest resources. Python provides
us many efficient libraries that are able to handle large data sets if used well. This repository shows how basic LiDAR analysis
functions work, and how to visualize, interpret and process LiDAR data sets in Python, with the goal of incorporating the lessons
into a full package in the future.
